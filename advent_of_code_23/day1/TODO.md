# REMEMBER:
- Figure out the problem in your head first.
- Then write pseudocode.
- THEN, write real code.

# Basis of Problem:
The target value of each line can be found by combining the first digit with the last digit to form a two-digit number.
If there is only one digit, that is both the first & the last digit.

For example:

2def1       = 21
lpl3rew8poq = 38
g1h2o3s4t7s = 17
pleb6ucher  = 66
= 142

# Task:
Calculate the sum of all the values.

# Mental solution:
Read in the input line by line.
Check for the first number in a line.
Check for the last number in a line.
Concatenate the 2 numbers.
Turn the 2-digit number into an int.
Add the new int to a running total.
