# REMEMBER:
- Figure out the problem in your head first. LOOK OUT FOR EDGE-CASES!
- Then write pseudocode.
- THEN, write real code.

# Basis of Problem:
Add all numbers that are adjacent (even diagonally) to a symbol.
A fullstop is NOT a symbol.

# Task:
Find the sum of all the valid numbers.

# Mental solution:
- Find each symbol in the input.
- For loop through each symbol.
-   Check the cooridnates that surround the symbol.
-   If you find a number, add that number to a temporary list.
-   Find all numbers that surround the symbol...?
- [How do you prevent duplicates without huge overhead???]
OR
- Look for every number in the input.
- Add that number to a list
- If = last number of list, ignore.
- Otherwise, check all the coordinates that surround the number.
- If any contain a symbol, add the number to a running total.

13619 - Too low.
506346 - Too low.
